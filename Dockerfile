# Dockerfile disabled.
# This repository prefers the Node.js App Platform buildpack (no Docker) for simplicity.
# If you need to enable Docker builds, rename `Dockerfile.disabled` to `Dockerfile`.
#
# NOTE: This file intentionally contains no `FROM` instruction to prevent
# DigitalOcean App Platform from auto-detecting it as a Docker build.
